<p> When the project opens, client will be asked for the first and last name. The client will enter the first and last name.

After that, directory will be asked where the file you want to send is located. Suppose we include:

C: / Workspace / notes.txt

Then, IP and port of the server will be asked which you want to send this image to: You need to enter IP and port in this format:
